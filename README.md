# Orange Travels and Tours (OTAT) Database System

This project involves creating a MySQL database system for **Orange Travels and Tours (OTAT)** to manage tour packages, bookings, participant details, and staff roles for both local and overseas tours. The system also handles payments, passport/visa validation, and includes provisions for cancellation and refunds.

## Features
- **Tour Package Management**: Store details of local and overseas tour packages, including travel dates, minimum and maximum participant limits.
- **Booking System**: Manage bookings for multiple participants under a single booking, including relevant participant information.
- **Overseas Tour Handling**: Validate passports and visas for participants on overseas tours.
- **Custom Tour Packages**: Allow customers to request custom tour packages, subject to negotiation.
- **Staff Assignment**: Assign a Tour Director (TD) for local tours, and both a TD and Assistant TD (ATD) for overseas tours.
- **Payment Management**: Ensure payments are made at least 2 weeks before the tour date.
- **Cancellation and Refunds**: Provide flexible policies for cancellation and refunds (assumed based on business rules).
